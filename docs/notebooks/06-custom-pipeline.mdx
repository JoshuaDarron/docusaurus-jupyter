# Custom Pipeline Execution

Paste or edit your own Aparavi DTC pipeline configuration below and execute it
directly from the browser. The default pipeline is pre-loaded as a starting
point — modify it or replace it entirely with your own.

## Pipeline Editor

Edit the JSON below to define your pipeline stages, then click **Load Pipeline**
to update the flow diagram and configuration table. Once loaded, click
**Execute Pipeline** to run it against the Aparavi API.

<PipelineEditor defaultConfig={pipelineConfig} />

## Tips

- Export a pipeline JSON from the [Aparavi platform](https://core.aparavi.com/)
  and paste it directly into the editor above.
- The JSON must contain a `components` array where each entry defines a pipeline
  stage with `id`, `provider`, `config`, `ui`, and `input` fields.
- Make sure your `.env` file has valid `APARAVI_API_KEY` and `APARAVI_BASE_URL`
  values before executing.
