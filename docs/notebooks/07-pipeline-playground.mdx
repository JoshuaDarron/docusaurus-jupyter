# Pipeline Playground

Run Aparavi DTC pipelines directly in the browser using your own API key. Enter
your credentials below, edit the pipeline configuration, and click
**Execute Pipeline** to see results.

<PipelinePlayground defaultConfig={pipelineConfig} />

## Tips

- Get your API key from the [Aparavi platform](https://core.aparavi.com/).
- The default base URL (`https://eaas.aparavi.com/`) works for most accounts.
  Change it only if your organization uses a different endpoint.
- Export a pipeline JSON from the Aparavi platform and paste it into the editor
  to run your own pipelines.
